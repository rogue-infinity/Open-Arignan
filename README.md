# Open-Arignan

**Arignar** is the tamil word for the well-read / the knowledgeable / the scholar. **Arignan** is an application that can help scholars, engineers, founders, etc... to maintain a local-first private knowledge base and get queries answered from it.

## Quick-Start

0. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/RishiNandha/Open-Arignan`

### Option 1: Git Clone + CLI

1. Run the `python setup.py --app-home <install dir>`. This will:
   - Download all the models needed, including the default local answer model and a lighter fallback answer model
   - Create a **bin directory** folder with executables
   - Print the bin directory for your reference
2. Add the bin directory folder to your PATH
3. Try `arignan load "filename.pdf"`
4. Try `arignan ask "relevant question"`

### Option 2: GUI

1. Run  `python setup.py --app-home <install dir>`
2. Run `arignan -gui`
3. Your browser opens locally
4. Use **Add More Files To Knowledge Base** to load material, then ask questions in the chat box

### Option 3: No Ollama — HuggingFace-only (runs everything through Python)

> Use this if you **don't want to install Ollama** at all. All model inference runs directly inside Python via HuggingFace Transformers. The trade-off is slightly higher RAM usage and no streaming, but zero extra tooling.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/RishiNandha/Open-Arignan`
2. Run setup with the `transformers` backend and the lightweight `qwen3:0.6b` model:
   ```bash
   python setup.py --app-home <install dir> \
       --llm-backend transformers \
       --llm-model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
       --lightweight
   ```
   This downloads **only** HuggingFace models — Ollama is never called.
3. Add the printed bin directory to your PATH.
4. Use exactly like any other install:
   ```bash
   arignan load "paper.pdf"
   arignan ask "What does this paper say about attention?"
   ```

> **Requirements:** Python 3.10+, ~4 GB free disk space for models, ~2 GB RAM. No GPU required (CPU inference works, just slower).

---

### Option 4: MCP

1. Run  `python setup.py --app-home <install dir>`

2. Add the following command into your MCP Client of choice (Github Copilot / Claude Code / etc)

```text
arignan --mcp --app-home <install dir>
```

The launch json would possibly look something like this:

```json
{
  "command": "arignan",
  "args": ["--mcp", "--app-home", "E:/arignan"]
}
```

3. Now Github Copilot / Claude Code can use `retrieve_context` tool to fetch local context on the fly. This is our flagship tool to check local papers, private docs, etc. Other tools exposed include `load_content`, `list_loads`, `delete_loads`, and `delete_hat`. Try asking something while mentioning "local library" or "arignan" in the chat windows with the LLMs on these platforms.

## Key Points

### Behavioral

- **Fully local RAG / Knowledge-base system**: Caching of proprietary docs, or things under NDA, or unpublished material free of all privacy concerns
- **Load and store knowledge over time**: Maybe software help docs as you discover them, research papers as you read them, personal notes, tutorial markdowns, textbooks, etc
- **Session history**: For detailed prompting workflows where the user might choose to ask a series of questions
- **User switches for topic/category**: For advanced users who might wear different "hats" and maintain different knowledge bases for each of them.
- **Wiki-first knowledge organization**: Topic pages are maintained as auditable wiki markdowns with related-topic links so the knowledge base remains useful for both humans and LLMs.

### Technical

- **Fully local LLM**: `qwen3:4b-q4_K_M` by default, with `qwen3:0.6b` also provisioned as a lighter answer mode option. Reconfigurable in settings.json
- **4-piece hybrid retreival system**:

  - **map.md files** tell the LLM "where to find what" in the subdirectories
  - **Semantic search** with a vectorDB RAG that fetches context from within the files
  - **User auditable knowledge base** LLM-generated markdowns gives quick context/summary to the LLM.
  - **Keyword search** for retrieving exact keyword matches
- **Incrementally load and deleting of knowledge**:

  - **Loading hook** appends the vector cache to the semantic RAG database, map.md for a quick lookup of "where to find what", and makes the LLM write a summary/knowledge-base markdown
  - **Deleting** allows picking a past load and undoing it gracefully
  - **Optional parameter "hat"** tells the load hook which subdirectory / subdivision of the knowledge base to write to.
- Default models chosen are with a 4GB consumer GPU in mind. LLM + Embedding + Reranking has been tested to work without swapping on a 4 GB VRAM.

### Entry Points

- **CLI Entry Points**:

  - **Session resetting**: Each terminal starts it's own session of maintaining chat history. The user can reset it with this command.
  - **QnA with citations**: Questions can be asked based on the knowledge. Each question is also answered with citations of which directory and file were referred to.
  - **Optional parameter "hat" in QnA** that narrows down where to search thereby improving latency. Set to "auto" by default, which goes through everything
  - **Loading Content**: Takes web url for a blog post / local address to a PDF or Markdown. Takes "hat" parameter which is "auto" by default.
  - **Deleting Content**: First displays the ingestion history with load_IDs. Then user picks the load_IDs to undo the past ingestion.
  - **Saving chat state**: Chat history has to be saved. Otherwise, it get's erase by default
  - **Loading chat state**: To load the saved chat history
  - **GUI launch**: `arignan -gui` starts the local browser UI and opens it automatically
- **MCP Entry Points**:

  - **Context Retrieval tool**: `retrieve_context` fetches reranked local context without calling an answer LLM
  - **Ask tool**: `ask` can either prepare a client-LLM answer package or use the local LLM, based on `settings.json`. It is disabled by default in `mcp.json`.
  - **Knowledge-base management tools**: load, list, delete, and hat-delete operations are available through MCP
  - **Global Map Resource**: `arignan://global-map` gives a high-level map of available local knowledge

## Detailed Description

### The Hats Concept

Open Arignan organizes knowledge into **namespaces called hats**, representing domains or roles such as Spiking Neural Networks, Entrepreneurship, or Psychology. Each hat has it's own:

- Vector Index
- Keyword (BM25) Index
- Summary knowledge base markdowns
- Original files
- map.md describing what to find where

A global map (global_map.md) provides a high-level view across all hats.

#### Storage Layout

The ingestion log allows for deleting any past loads. An LLM-generated global map describes which hat contains what knowledge.

```text
~/.arignan/
|-- settings.json
|-- ingestion_log.jsonl
`-- hats/
    |-- default/
    |   |-- vector_index/
    |   |-- bm25_index/
    |   |-- summaries/
    |   |   `-- <topic_folder>/
    |   |       |-- original_files/
    |   |       |-- summary.md
    |   |       |-- topic_index.md
    |   |       |-- <optional_segment_markdowns>
    |   |       `-- .topic_manifest.json
    |   |-- topic_graph.json
    |   `-- map.md
    |-- <hat_name>/
    |   |-- vector_index/
    |   |-- bm25_index/
    |   |-- summaries/
    |   |   `-- <topic_folder>/
    |   |       |-- original_files/
    |   |       |-- summary.md
    |   |       |-- topic_index.md
    |   |       |-- <optional_segment_markdowns>
    |   |       `-- .topic_manifest.json
    |   |-- topic_graph.json
    |   `-- map.md
    `-- global_map.md
```
In each `<topic_folder>`, the main wiki article page lives at `summary.md`, the compact lookup companion lives at `topic_index.md`, and the manifest keeps grouped-source metadata explicit. Each hat also keeps a lightweight `topic_graph.json` so related topics can link to each other with confidence-scored backlinks.

#### Knowledge-base Organization

The summaries/ directory is LLM-organized and human-auditable. Each subfolder represents a topic grouping and the folder name inferred from the grouping decision.

Each folder contains the original source file(s) and the generated wiki markdowns directly under the topic folder. The main wiki-style article page is `summary.md`, while `topic_index.md` is a lighter companion page for quick lookup cues, connections, source coverage, and related-topic links. If a topic becomes too large, the same topic folder can also contain additional segment markdowns. The system gives the LLM the flexibility to do grouping based on size and semantic relatedness:

- **Related documents can be grouped in one folder**: For example: multiple papers on a related coherent topic JEPA can be summarized into one markdown in one folder
- **Large documents can have multiple markdowns**: For example: Behzad Razavi RFIC Design might typically one per section

### Ingestion & Deletion Models

Each document ingestion is a tracked event with its own `load_id`. Accepted inputs:

- Web url to blogs / wikis
- Local path to a PDF
- Local path to a Markdown
- Local path to a folder of PDFs/Markdowns

#### Chunk Parsing

Parsing for the vector index and keyword index are done using headings wherever possible, or with chunk size limits. The rules used are:

- Prefer section-based chunking using detected headings
- Treat common academic sections such as abstract, introduction, methods, experiments, results, and conclusion as stronger boundaries when parsing research PDFs
- Fall back to text splitting for unstructured or long text
- Maintain small overlap between adjacent chunks
- Preserve metadata such as load_id, source path, section / header / page number
- Enrich chunk text with lightweight local context so retrieval sees what document and section family a chunk came from

#### Embedding

Embedding model used is `Alibaba-NLP/gte-modernbert-base` by default, with `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` used by `--lightweight` setup. The configured retrieval models are stored in `settings.json` and cached locally under the app-home `models/` directory. Each chunk stores:

- The embedding vector
- Canonical chunk text
- Metadata to be used for:
  - Citation: Path, Page Number / Section / Heading
  - Deletion: Load_id

Vector Index is done using Qdrant and HNSW for storing both embedding and metadata. Lexical Index is using BM25

#### Topic Grouping and Segmentation

Grouping of files into a single topic or segmentation of a single file into multiple markdowns is handled in a wiki-first flow, with `max_md_length` acting as the main size guardrail.

**Grouping:**

1. The system first writes provisional topic pages for the current load
2. At the end of the load, the main local LLM reviews the full list of topic summaries in the hat and proposes possible groups with confidence scores
3. A proposed group is only applied if the confidence is high enough and the estimated combined markdown stays within `max_md_length`
4. If topics are grouped, the wiki-style markdown is regenerated from the grouped sources

**Segmentation:**

1. The system sees the size of the file. If its a book, it goes chapter-wise rightaway (common-case fast)
2. Otherwise, the system estimates the length of a markdown if it had to be write it. And if its more than `max_md_length` then it tries to break it down heading or topic wise.

#### Editting Markdowns and Log

LLM is systematically prompted to maintain wiki-style markdown one topic at a time.

- Knowledge base markdowns:
  - `summary.md`: the main wiki article page for the topic
  - `topic_index.md`: a compact lookup companion for retrieval cues, connections, and source coverage
- `map.md` to be rich in the following information:
  - Paths to files
  - What to expect from the files, like "RF IC textbook"
  - Any specific keywords, like "Calibre xRC"
  - Quick lookup of which topic folder to descend into
- The `global_map.md` to point to the relevant "hat" which would have the relevant map.md. It should have high-level keywords like "JEPA".

**Ingestion Log** is append-only, like commit history and each addition or deletion is logged with the path to reach the relevant changes made it so that the delete function can use this to lookup.

### Deletion

Using the Ingestion log, the files are remove, map.md is updated and the vector and keyword indices are updated. The markdowns is deleted if standalone. If in a grouped setting, then it's regenerated from all the raw sources in the same group again.

### Retrieval Pipeline

1. **Query Expansion**: The system first normalizes the query and adds expansions of abbreviations used
2. **Hat Classification**: When the hat is unspecified, the system first classifies which hat to descend down to
3. **3-way Retrieval**:
   - Qdrant retrieves top-k chunks
   - BM25 retrieves top-k chunks
   - Descending down the maps retrieves the knowledge base markdown. (If the markdown is large, headings are treated as individual chunks).
4. **Reciprocal Rank Fusion**: Chunks that appear in both Qdrant and BM25 are awarded higher score, and the rest are pruned
5. **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: The chunks are reranked. This removes false positives, and removes irrelevant chunks from the markdown. Default cross-encoder used is `Alibaba-NLP/gte-reranker-modernbert-base`, while `--lightweight` setup uses `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-xsmall-v1`
6. **Wiki Links and Topic Graph**: Related-topic links and the per-hat topic graph give the retrieval flow additional wiki structure to descend through when grouped topics are close but not identical.
7. **Final Answer Mode**: `ask` can use the default local LLM, a lighter local LLM, deterministic retrieval synthesis, or a raw reranked-context dump via `--answer-mode default|light|none|raw`
8. (To implement in future): Adjacent Content Expansion.

### Session Scope

Each time Arignan is called in a new terminal, it starts a new session and **associates the PID of the terminal with the session**.

Each session has:

- A KV Cache in-memory optionally (configured in settings.json)
- A conversation history JSON
- A session ID

KV Cache reset behavior is currently represented in session metadata and is reset either with a timeout, with a soft token limit or upon a session reset.

Active context is maintained in a JSON while the session is active. This can be saved by the user with a command. A user can also load another JSON as the context.

#### Self-Summary Rollover

When the chat history is becoming too long:

- LLM rewrites the dialogue into a session summary
- Older turns are removed from active prompt context
- Session continues with:
  - System prompt
  - Session summary
  - Recent turns
  - Fresh retrieved context
- The session JSON is overwritten with this summarized context (since unlike a chatbot, chat history holds no significance to us)

## Setup

### For Users

#### With Ollama (default — recommended)
1. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and make sure it is running.
2. Setup: `python setup.py --app-home <install dir>`
3. Optional lightweight setup for smaller GPUs: `python setup.py --app-home <install dir> --lightweight`
4. Optional smaller/custom local model during setup: `python setup.py --app-home <install dir> --llm-model <model_name> --llm-backend ollama`
5. Optional post-setup model change: edit `settings.json`

#### Without Ollama — HuggingFace / Transformers backend
If you prefer not to install Ollama, Arignan can run the answer model entirely through Python using HuggingFace Transformers. This is the fastest way to get started on any machine that has Python already.

```bash
python setup.py --app-home <install dir> \
    --llm-backend transformers \
    --llm-model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
    --lightweight
```

- `--llm-backend transformers` — skips Ollama entirely; model is loaded directly into Python
- `--llm-model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` — the default lightweight answer model (~400 MB download)
- `--lightweight` — also selects smaller embedding and reranker models to keep total footprint low

After setup, **all the same CLI commands work unchanged** — no need to specify a backend again.

#### Common commands (apply to both backends)
1. Add **Bin directory** to PATH. The setup.py will automatically print the bin directory for you.
2. Help: `arignan --help`
3. Load: `arignan load "filename.pdf"`
4. Load with hat: `arignan load "filename.pdf" --hat psychology`
5. QnA: `arignan ask "What is JEPA?"`
6. QnA with hat: `arignan ask "How to use CalibreRC" --hat "IC Design"`
7. Optional answer mode: `arignan ask "What is JEPA?" --answer-mode light`
8. Ingestion Log: `arignan list-loads`
9. Delete a past ingestion: `arignan delete <load_id>`
10. Reset context: `arignan reset-session`
11. Save context: `arignan save-session <path/session_name.json>`
12. Reload context: `arignan load-session <path/session_name.json>`

#### Prompt Editing

- Prompt can be editted in `<app_home>/prompts.json`.
- `{retrieved_passages_block}` inserts the retrieved content into answer prompts.
- `{question}` injects the user’s current ask. For example, `Alex said, "{retrieved_passages_block}". Accord to Alex answer: "{question}"`.
- For conversational or no-context prompts, use `{recent_dialogue_block}` and `{session_summary_block}` to utilize the KV Cache.

#### MCP Editing

- MCP tool descriptions can be editted in `<app_home>/mcp.json`.
- MCP prompts can also be editted in `<app_home>/mcp.json`.
- `find_from_local_library` is the built-in MCP prompt that nudges clients toward `retrieve_context` for grounded local-library lookups.
- `settings.json` controls MCP backend behavior:
  - `mcp_llm_backend`: `client` by default, or `local` if MCP should call the local answer LLM directly.

### For Developers

1. Install dependencies: `python -m pip install -e .[dev]`
2. Run tests: `python -m pytest`
3. GitHub Actions now runs `python -m pip install .[dev]` and then `python -m pytest` automatically on every push and pull request through `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
4. Debug Load Command: `arignan load "filepath" --debug`
5. Debug Ask Command: `arignan ask "question" --debug`

#### To manually test MCP: 

Use this command to launch it as a HTTP server:

```text
arignan --mcp-http --app-home E:/arignan --mcp-host 127.0.0.1 --mcp-port 8765
```

Then start the Inspector with:

```text
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Then set the transport to streamable HTTP, enter http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp as the URL and connect through proxy.
