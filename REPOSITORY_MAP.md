# Repository Map for LLMs and AI Agents

This file is a fast orientation guide for agents that need to patch the repository safely.

## What This Repo Is

`open-arignan` is a local-first knowledge-base and retrieval system with:

- CLI commands for loading content, asking questions, deleting ingestions, and managing sessions
- hat-based storage namespaces under one app-home
- ingestion for markdown, PDFs, folders, and URLs
- hybrid retrieval across dense, lexical, and markdown/map artifacts
- local-LLM-authored `summary.md`, `map.md`, `global_map.md`, and final `ask` answers
- auditable wiki-style topic pages with related-topic links and per-hat topic graphs

Important current reality:

- setup provisions a managed local text-model runtime and runtime uses it for markdown artifacts and final `ask` answers
- the default local text model is `qwen3:4b-q4_K_M`
- setup self-heal now also normalizes the earlier mistaken `gemma4:e2b` default back to `qwen3:4b-q4_K_M`
- `ask` now reuses the main local text generator across default/light conversational flows so the app does not swap in a second full chat LLM at ask time
- the default retrieval models are `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` and `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-base-v1`
- `--lightweight` setup switches retrieval to `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` and `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-xsmall-v1`
- on Windows, setup bundles the local model runtime inside the app-home so users do not need a separate install/serve step
- dense retrieval prefers local Qdrant storage when available and falls back to JSON storage otherwise
- normal `ask` runs now use a compact in-place status line on `stderr`
- `ask --debug` still prints detailed retrieval/model trace output
- swallowed LLM failures now write full tracebacks to a session-local `exceptions.log`
- Ollama streams that emit only thinking and no final answer text are now treated as explicit runtime failures, and the generator clears its ready-state so later turns can re-check runtime health
- markdown-generation and RAG-answer prompts now live in `<app_home>/prompts.json` and can be edited without reinstalling
- default prompt templates now keep system prompts static and put dynamic user-turn context at the end of user prompts for better Ollama prompt-cache reuse
- ask-route classification prompts also live in `<app_home>/prompts.json`, and default/light asks classify `retrieve` vs `chat_context` before running RAG
- ask-route classification now supports `ask_route_backend = "llm" | "embedding"` in `settings.json`
- the GUI ask composer now exposes both rerank-candidate count and final answer-context count as independent per-question overrides
- the GUI `Show Thinking` control is now an accessible toggle-style button instead of a plain checkbox
- conversational/default answer flows now pass recent turns to Ollama as chat `messages` instead of embedding the transcript verbatim into the prompt body
- conversational follow-up and route-classification prompts now keep prior turns in Ollama `messages` and send the current user turn as the real final chat message, instead of re-stuffing chat history into the prompt body
- `arignan --mcp` now launches a framed stdio MCP server, and an integration test handshakes with that real entrypoint in a subprocess
- normal answer generation now asks the local LLM for up to `4096` new tokens instead of the earlier small caps, and Ollama crash-like failures get one clean retry

## Top-Level Layout

```text
.
|-- README.md
|-- REPOSITORY_MAP.md
|-- setup.py
|-- pyproject.toml
|-- src/arignan/
|-- tests/
|-- docs/
|-- .setuptools/        # packaging scratch/output
`-- __pycache__/        # generated cache
```

Read these first:

- `README.md`: source-of-truth architecture intent
  - now includes a short `prompts.json` editing note covering retrieval placeholders vs. chat-history placeholders
- `src/arignan/application.py`: main orchestration layer
  - now owns the ask-route classifier, shared session-context prompt blocks, single-main-LLM reuse for ask flows, the split between conversational system instructions vs. real chat-turn messages, honest no-context/local-LLM-failure fallback wording, and the raised default answer-generation token cap
  - multi-source loads now record per-document ingestion events, and delete expands parent batch IDs to their child load IDs
- `src/arignan/cli.py`: CLI surface and user-visible flow
- `src/arignan/config.py`: defaults and settings behavior
- `src/arignan/setup_flow.py`: user bootstrap flow

## Main Execution Paths

### User Setup

Command:

```text
python setup.py
```

Flow:

1. `setup.py`
2. `src/arignan/setup_flow.py:run_setup`
3. package install
4. app-home initialization
5. managed local-runtime provisioning
6. `bin/` launcher creation

Packaging note:

- `setup.py` also dispatches `egg_info`, `bdist_wheel`, and similar packaging commands back to setuptools. Do not break that split behavior when editing setup.

### CLI

Command:

```text
arignan ...
```

Flow:

1. `src/arignan/cli.py`
2. `src/arignan/config.py:load_config`
3. `src/arignan/application.py:ArignanApp`
4. subsystem-specific modules

Commands currently implemented:

- `load`
- `ask`
- `retrieve`
- `delete`
- `list-loads`
- `save-session`
- `load-session`
- `reset-session`

CLI behavior worth remembering:

- progress messages print to `stderr` with an `[arignan] ...` prefix
- normal `ask` uses a compact spinner-style status reporter instead of line-by-line progress spam
- `ask` supports `--answer-mode default|light|none|raw`
- default/light `ask` first runs a small route classifier to decide whether to retrieve or continue directly from chat context
- `retrieve` runs retrieval + reranking only and never calls an answer LLM
- `load --debug` and `ask --debug` print model-call traces and internal details
- uncaught CLI exceptions are logged to the active session log before being re-raised

### MCP

Flow:

1. `arignan --mcp`
2. `src/arignan/cli.py:launch_mcp`
3. `src/arignan/mcp/stdio_server.py`
4. `src/arignan/mcp/server.py`
5. `ArignanApp`
6. retrieval pipeline + reranker

Implemented MCP surface:

- tools: `retrieve_context`
- resource: `arignan://global-map`

## Source Map by Area

### Configuration, Paths, and Model Registry

- `src/arignan/config.py`
  - owns `AppConfig`
  - writes and loads `settings.json`
  - now recreates a missing `settings.json` automatically from defaults at runtime so accidental deletion does not leave the app-home unusable
  - defaults the local markdown-generation backend to the managed local runtime
  - now includes `ask_route_backend` so route classification can use either the main LLM or the embedder
  - stores both the default local answer model and the lightweight local answer model
  - infers `local_llm_backend` for older settings files that only stored a model string
  - enforces that `embedding_model` is fixed and cannot be overridden in settings
- `src/arignan/paths.py`
  - resolves app home and settings paths
  - supports explicit `--app-home`, `ARIGNAN_HOME`, persisted app-home pointer, then fallback `~/.arignan`
- `src/arignan/model_registry.py`
  - shared model alias resolution
  - local-LLM backend inference for config migration
  - local-runtime model-tag normalization for the default markdown-generation path
  - carries the legacy mistaken Gemma default marker so setup can migrate it back to Qwen
  - model-id sanitization
  - model storage directory derivation
  - this is the shared source used by setup and runtime loading
- `src/arignan/prompts.py`
  - owns prompt defaults, `prompts.json` creation/loading, and placeholder rendering for user-edited prompt templates
  - now includes dedicated prompt slots for retrieval-grounded answers, conversational follow-up answers, and no-context warning answers
  - conversational/classifier prompt defaults are now instruction-only and no longer inline session-summary placeholders by default
  - default answer prompts order stable session context before retrieved context and place the current question last
  - default topic-summary prompts are example-driven and ask for concrete wiki-style specifics rather than generic abstracts
  - now recreates a missing `prompts.json` automatically from defaults at runtime so prompt editing remains recoverable after accidental deletion

### Storage and Schemas

- `src/arignan/storage/layout.py`
  - creates and validates the on-disk structure
  - `auto` is a runtime selector only and cannot be a persisted hat name
- `src/arignan/models/`
  - canonical dataclasses for documents, chunks, ingestion events, retrieval hits, and sessions

### Ingestion

- `src/arignan/ingestion/discovery.py`
  - resolves inputs from URLs, markdown, PDFs, and folders
- `src/arignan/ingestion/parsers.py`
  - normalizes source content into `ParsedDocument`
- `src/arignan/ingestion/log.py`
  - append/read support for `ingestion_log.jsonl`
- `src/arignan/ingestion/service.py`
  - ingestion batch orchestration and `load_id` creation
  - folder/mass uploads now assign each source a child load ID while retaining parent batch metadata
  - partial-success folder loads still preserve a parent batch event so the visible parent `load_id` remains meaningful

### Indexing

- `src/arignan/indexing/chunking.py`
  - heading-aware chunking with overlap
  - current defaults favor larger chunks and fewer fragments
  - adjacent page-like sections can now be merged into one chunk-sized span instead of being forced into one chunk per PDF page
  - academic PDFs now treat roles like abstract / methods / results / conclusion as stronger boundaries
  - chunk text is enriched with a short `Context: ...` prefix so retrieval sees local document/section cues
- `src/arignan/indexing/embedding.py`
  - `HashingEmbedder` for deterministic fallback behavior
  - sentence-transformer embedder is now used by the live app when cached retrieval models are available
  - best-effort GPU offload now reports full tracebacks to `stderr` instead of failing silently
- `src/arignan/indexing/dense.py`
  - `DenseIndexer`
  - `LocalDenseIndex`
  - prefers Qdrant local mode if available
  - falls back to JSON-backed dense storage if Qdrant import is unavailable
  - Qdrant collection-shape introspection now catches only the expected compatibility exceptions instead of a blanket `Exception`
- `src/arignan/indexing/lexical.py`
  - BM25-style lexical index

### Grouping and Markdown Artifacts

- `src/arignan/graph/topic_graph.py`
  - builds a lightweight per-hat topic graph from topic manifests and summary excerpts
  - emits confidence-scored related-topic edges with `EXTRACTED` / `INFERRED` relation labels
- `src/arignan/grouping/planner.py`
  - decides standalone vs merge vs segment
  - deterministic length/segmentation guardrail around the grouping policy
  - the topic folder chosen here now remains the active topic folder; there is no second-stage canonical renaming pass
  - merge scoring is intentionally less timid so moderate but concrete retrieval evidence can group related papers into one wiki page
- `src/arignan/markdown/rendering.py`
  - shared deterministic rendering helpers
  - shared keyword extraction / text cleanup / markdown table helpers
  - fallback topic summaries are meant to read like retrieval-facing wiki lookup pages, not source note dumps
  - active deterministic source for exported markdown helpers
- `src/arignan/markdown/generator.py`
  - repository/storage layer for topic folders
  - writes topic manifests
  - writes topic markdown files directly under the topic folder
  - each non-empty topic folder now also gets `topic_index.md` as a compact wiki navigation companion to the main article page
  - synchronizes a per-hat `topic_graph.json` file and pushes related-topic links back into manifests and topic markdowns
  - regenerates hat/global maps from manifests
  - now supports batching by skipping map refreshes until the caller requests them
- `src/arignan/markdown/writer.py`
  - artifact rendering boundary
  - heuristic fallback rendering
  - local-LLM-backed artifact generation
  - topic, hat-map, and global-map prompt text now comes from the loaded prompt set under app-home instead of hard-coded module constants
  - topic-summary prompting now treats `summary.md` as the main article page of a compiled wiki, with grouped-topic coherence and `## Related Threads` for retrieval-oriented lookup
  - prompt defaults now emphasize concrete mechanisms, named entities, and lookup paths instead of generic summaries
  - progress reporting for LLM calls
  - session-local traceback logging for swallowed LLM failures
- `src/arignan/llm/runtime.py`
  - provides the managed local generation adapter used by default for markdown artifacts and final answers
  - still contains an explicit transformers runtime path for non-default/back-compat use
  - strips reasoning blocks from managed-runtime output before markdown validation
  - now records the last Ollama runtime failure detail and resets model readiness after connect, HTTP, non-JSON, or thinking-only-empty-answer failures
  - now performs one clean retry after crash-like Ollama failures by re-checking runtime/model readiness once instead of immediately giving up
- `src/arignan/llm/service.py`
  - provisions the managed local runtime bundle during setup
  - auto-starts the local runtime in the background on first use
  - pulls both configured answer models into `<app_home>/models`
- `src/arignan/runtime_env.py`
  - forces Arignan's process into the text-only Transformers path
  - disables TensorFlow and Flax backends so local LLM calls do not drift into unused backend imports

Topic folder invariant:

```text
<app_home>/hats/<hat>/summaries/<topic_folder>/
|-- original_files/
|-- summary.md
|-- topic_index.md
`-- .topic_manifest.json
```

Hat-level graph invariant:

```text
<app_home>/hats/<hat>/
|-- topic_graph.json
`-- map.md
```

### Retrieval and Reranking

- `src/arignan/retrieval/pipeline.py`
  - query expansion
  - hat selection
  - dense search
  - lexical search
  - markdown/map retrieval
  - topic-link information becomes visible to retrieval through `topic_index.md` and updated summary pages
  - reciprocal rank fusion
  - current defaults intentionally pull a larger candidate set so more context can survive into reranking and final answers
  - progress reporting for multi-step retrieval
- `src/arignan/retrieval/reranking.py`
  - heuristic reranker
  - cross-encoder boundary for future runtime integration
  - best-effort GPU offload now reports full tracebacks to `stderr` instead of failing silently

### Sessions and Exception Logs

- `src/arignan/session/store.py`
  - persisted active/saved session JSON
  - per-PID active session directories for logs
  - active exception log path helper
  - clears stale active-session artifacts when a brand-new session is started
- `src/arignan/session/manager.py`
  - PID-scoped session lifecycle
  - rollover logic
  - idle timeout metadata handling
- `src/arignan/session/summarizer.py`
  - current deterministic summarizer
- `src/arignan/session/exception_log.py`
  - appends full exception tracebacks to active-session log files

Active session log invariant:

```text
<app_home>/sessions/active/
|-- pid-<pid>.json
`-- pid-<pid>/exceptions.log
```

### App Orchestration

- `src/arignan/application.py`
  - highest-value file for most behavior changes
  - wires ingestion, indexing, markdown generation, retrieval, reranking, deletion, and sessions
  - centralizes dense and lexical indexer construction
  - batches map regeneration during `load` and grouped-topic regeneration to avoid redundant LLM calls
  - owns user-facing progress emission for multi-step operations
  - `load` now writes provisional topic summaries first, then runs one post-load regroup pass over the finished topic summaries in the hat
  - owns both the shared retrieval-only path and the ask-route classifier
  - the ask-route classifier now supports both the original LLM path and an alternate embedder-similarity path
  - routes prior turns into chat-message lists for conversational/default Ollama calls instead of pasting the transcript directly into the prompt body
  - after regrouping, the current load is reindexed once from the final manifests so the CLI summary and retrieval state reflect final grouped topics rather than provisional folders
  - the regroup step is now batch-based: the light LLM sees the full topic list for the hat and returns confidence-scored merge recommendations instead of one topic-at-a-time hints
  - grouping now compares the incoming document’s provisional topic summary against every existing topic summary in the hat before deciding merge vs standalone
  - `ask()` supports four answer modes: default LLM, light LLM, deterministic synthesis, and raw reranked context
  - `ask()` calls the shared local text generator for default answers and a separate lightweight generator for `--answer-mode light`
  - `ask()` now supports a per-question reranker breadth override and automatically widens the fused shortlist enough for that override to matter
  - `ask()` now short-circuits conversational follow-ups away from RAG and answers from recent session context instead
  - normal `default` and `light` asks can now continue through the LLM even when retrieval finds no useful local context, with an explicit warning instead of a dead-end response
  - answer-generation and grouping-review prompt text now comes from the loaded prompt set under app-home
  - final answer prompting now uses a wider reranked-context budget than earlier revisions
  - raw mode returns filtered reranked context directly instead of generating a prose answer

### GUI

- `src/arignan/gui/react_server.py`
  - serves the browser GUI
  - handles direct and task-based GUI API routes for `load` and `ask`
  - tracks compact in-memory task progress for the browser spinner/status bubbles
  - ask tasks now also carry a short progress history plus partial streamed answer text for live pending-bubble updates
  - automatic browser-open failures are now printed with full tracebacks instead of being swallowed silently
  - auto-opens the browser for the `arignan -gui` flow
- `src/arignan/gui/server.py`
  - legacy pre-React GUI server module kept only as a historical fallback/reference
  - not the exported GUI entrypoint; `arignan.gui` re-exports from `react_server.py`
- `src/arignan/gui/frontend/index.html`
  - React host page for the browser client
- `src/arignan/gui/frontend/app.jsx`
  - chat-style React client with modal load flow, task polling, spinner-bubble updates, and bottom-follow behavior that only auto-scrolls when the user is already near the latest message
  - includes a per-question reranker-candidate field so harder asks can widen evidence selection without editing `settings.json`
  - pending ask bubbles now show recent progress stages and partial streamed answer text while the final answer is still being generated
- `src/arignan/gui/frontend/styles.css`
  - dark responsive frontend styling for desktop, half-window, and mobile layouts
- `src/arignan/cli.py`
  - supports `-gui` / `--gui` as a one-command local GUI launch path
  - now also exposes `retrieve` for no-LLM reranked context inspection and `--mcp` for the stdio MCP server
- `src/arignan/mcp/stdio_server.py`
  - framed stdio MCP transport
  - handles `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `resources/list`, `resources/read`, and `ping`

## Behavior That Is Intentionally Simplified

These are the main places where the repo still keeps deterministic fallbacks even though the live app prefers real local models when available:

- `src/arignan/application.py:generate_answer`
  - primary final-answer path
  - builds the LLM prompt from session summary and top retrieved hits while recent turns flow separately as chat messages when supported
  - falls back to deterministic synthesis on local-runtime failure
- `src/arignan/application.py:compose_answer`
  - answer-mode switch for `default`, `light`, `none`, and `raw`
- `src/arignan/application.py:synthesize_answer`
  - deterministic fallback for final answers when the local LLM is unavailable
- `src/arignan/indexing/embedding.py:HashingEmbedder`
  - used for deterministic fallback behavior in tests or empty app-homes
- `src/arignan/retrieval/reranking.py:HeuristicReranker`
  - deterministic fallback reranker when cached local reranker weights are unavailable
- `src/arignan/session/summarizer.py`
  - rollover summary is deterministic, not LLM-authored

If you upgrade one of these areas to a real runtime, patch tests and docs at the same time.

## Common Patch Tasks

### Change CLI behavior or user-facing progress

Touch:

- `src/arignan/cli.py`
- `src/arignan/application.py`
- relevant integration tests in `tests/integration/test_cli_smoke.py`

Remember:

- normal `ask` progress is intentionally compressed; if you add new internal progress events, decide whether they belong in the compact reporter or only in debug mode

### Change setup/bootstrap behavior

Touch:

- `setup.py`
- `src/arignan/setup_flow.py`
- `src/arignan/model_registry.py`

### Change ingestion or parsing

Touch:

- `src/arignan/ingestion/discovery.py`
- `src/arignan/ingestion/parsers.py`

- `tests/unit/test_session_logging.py`
- `tests/integration/test_session_persistence.py`

## Key Invariants

- `local_llm_model` is configurable; `embedding_model` is not
- `local_llm_backend` defaults to `ollama`, but normal user setup hides that implementation detail behind the managed runtime flow
- app home defaults to `~/.arignan`
- `--hat` defaults to `auto`
- persisted hat names cannot be `auto`
- grouped topic state is tracked through `.topic_manifest.json`
- deleting a grouped load should regenerate surviving grouped markdown, not blindly delete the topic
- `map.md` and `global_map.md` are regenerated from manifests
- setup provisions the managed local runtime and writes a local runtime manifest into `<app_home>/models`
- Arignan force-disables TensorFlow and Flax backends for its local text runtime
- active session exceptions are logged to `<app_home>/sessions/active/pid-<pid>/exceptions.log`
- `load` and grouped delete/regeneration should avoid redundant map/global-map refreshes inside inner loops
- the GUI header now exposes small utility buttons for opening the active exception log, `settings.json`, and `prompts.json`
- the GUI backend owns a narrow `/api/open-file/{target}` route for those utility buttons and self-heals missing settings/prompts/log targets before opening them
- the MCP stdio entrypoint now defers `ArignanApp` construction until the first real MCP tool/resource operation, so `initialize` can return without waiting for retrieval-model startup
- `tests/unit/test_llm_runtime.py` explicitly isolates Ollama retry-path behavior from host-specific runtime provisioning, so CI no longer depends on a discoverable local Ollama install
- `arignan.cli` now lazy-imports `ArignanApp` only inside command handlers and MCP launch, so import-time side effects do not block the stdio initialize handshake
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_stdio.py` now explicitly guards the initialize-before-app-construction contract for the MCP entrypoint
- the MCP stdio server logs lifecycle and tool/resource activity to `stderr` under an `[arignan-mcp]` prefix while reserving `stdout` exclusively for framed protocol traffic
- the GUI ask flow now exposes a minimal cooperative cancel path through `/api/tasks/{task_id}/cancel`, and active ask tasks can settle into a `canceled` status without widening cancellation across load/delete flows
- the MCP stdio reader now also logs incoming header maps and a truncated preview of each received JSON payload to `stderr` for handshake debugging
- the GUI composer reuses the same primary action button for `Ask` and `Stop`; there is no separate cancel control in the composer row
- the MCP entrypoint is now SDK-native: `src/arignan/mcp/server.py` builds a `FastMCP` server directly, `arignan --mcp` runs the SDK stdio transport, and the retrieve/global-map surfaces stay lazy behind an app factory so Ollama is not touched during MCP initialize
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_server.py` now uses the official SDK's in-memory session helper, and `tests/integration/test_mcp_stdio.py` now probes the SDK's real newline-delimited stdio transport instead of the repo's removed custom framing
- the project now pins `starlette>=0.37.2,<0.39` explicitly so the FastAPI GUI stack remains compatible while the MCP SDK is installed
- the MCP package export surface is now intentionally small (`build_mcp_server` plus the logged stdio runner), and generated `src/open_arignan.egg-info/` packaging artifacts have been removed from the source tree as non-runtime fluff
- `settings.json` now includes `mcp_llm_backend`, defaulting to `client`, so MCP answer flows can stay off the local Ollama path unless explicitly opted into `local`
- `mcp.json` now lives beside `settings.json` and `prompts.json`, self-heals when missing, and carries editable MCP server instructions plus tool/resource/prompt descriptions
- the MCP server now exposes a broader SDK-backed tool surface: `retrieve_context`, `ask`, `load_content`, `list_loads`, `delete_loads`, `delete_hat`, plus the `arignan://global-map` resource
- MCP tools can now be individually disabled from `mcp.json` with an `enabled` flag, and `ask` is intentionally disabled by default so MCP clients prefer `retrieve_context`
- MCP no longer exposes session-management tools; session save/load/reset remain CLI/app concerns rather than MCP tools
- `mcp.json` now also carries an editable FastMCP prompt, `find_from_local_library`, which nudges clients toward retrieval-first local-library lookups
- MCP `ask` now splits cleanly by backend:
  - `mcp_llm_backend=client` prepares a client-LLM answer package without invoking the local answer model
  - `mcp_llm_backend=local` uses the local Arignan answer flow lazily
- the MCP stdio entrypoint now uses a thin SDK-backed wrapper that logs raw inbound payload previews plus initialize/ping receipt to `stderr`, while the underlying MCP protocol/session stack still comes from the official Python MCP SDK
- the MCP lazy app wrapper now starts a background retrieval-model load for embedding + reranking on startup but no longer uses timed GPU offload; retrieval-model release is request-driven instead
- the MCP lazy app wrapper now emits timing logs for app resolve and retrieval-usage enter/leave, while the GUI task context emits matching lock wait/acquire/release timing logs for ask/load/delete work
- MCP retrieval-like tool calls are now serialized behind a single retrieval gate inside the lazy MCP app wrapper, so one MCP server process cannot load or use the retrieval singleton concurrently from overlapping requests
- MCP app initialization now uses a short-lock plus init-event pattern, so slow `ArignanApp` construction happens outside the shared state mutex and concurrent callers wait on initialization completion rather than stalling behind a long-held lock
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_gui_parallel.py` now locks in the GUI+MCP overlap contract with fake embedder/reranker/local-generator classes, proving the first MCP retrieval call can wait behind an active GUI ask and still complete without duplicate model usage
- MCP-side `ArignanApp` construction now uses `preload_retrieval_models=False`, so the MCP app object is built quickly and the background retrieval-model load thread explicitly loads only the embedder and reranker afterward through `ArignanApp.warm_retrieval_models()`
- `README.md` now includes a one-line manual MCP debugging command using the official Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector arignan --mcp --app-home E:/arignan`
- `cli.py` now supports both MCP transports:
  - `--mcp` for stdio
  - `--mcp-http` plus `--mcp-host` / `--mcp-port` for separate-process Streamable HTTP debugging
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_http.py` verifies the new Streamable HTTP entry point by starting a subprocess server and connecting through the official Python MCP SDK client

## Agent Tips

- Start from `ArignanApp` if you need to understand user-visible behavior
- Start from `StorageLayout`, `MarkdownRepository`, and `SessionStore` if your patch changes filesystem shape
- Start from `model_registry.py` if your patch touches setup/runtime model resolution
- Start from `markdown/rendering.py` if your patch is deterministic markdown cleanup or keyword extraction
- Treat docs in `docs/` as implementation-state notes, not the primary runtime surface
- Ignore `.setuptools/` and `__pycache__/` unless you are debugging packaging or caches
- If a change touches setup, retrieval, storage layout, or sessions, verify both unit and integration coverage

## Recent Notes

- README MCP docs now include both:
  - the separate-process Inspector UI flow for `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`
  - the direct Inspector CLI probe:
    - `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp --transport http --method tools/list`
